ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Akatsuki Landing Page!

Hey there! This is my first project for The Odin Project, and I'm excited to present to you the Akatsuki Landing Page. As a beginner, I've put in a lot of effort to create this page, though I admit that the code may not be the most user-friendly or organized.

In this repository, you'll find the code, design files, and assets that I've used for this landing page. It's a small project, but it's been a valuable learning experience for me.

Feel free to explore, fork, or even contribute to this project if you'd like. I appreciate your understanding that the code may not be perfect. Let's continue learning and improving together!

Thank you for checking out my work. Happy coding! ðŸ–¤âœ¨
